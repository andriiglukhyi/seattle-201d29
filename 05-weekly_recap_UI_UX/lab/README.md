# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 5

There are two parts to your lab assignment, and each is in a different assignment in Canvas:

### First Part: In lab today

Your lab for today is in [this repository](https://github.com/codefellows/201-lab-5). Fork and clone that repo, then follow the instructions very carefully.

### Second Part: Over the weekend

One of them is a weekend project: put finishing touches on your About Me project and get it **deployed** via GH Pages. This will be due at 11:59pm on Sunday evening. The more time you spend with this, the better you'll get at CSS, but keep in mind that you also have readings to do and need to get some rest and relaxation in as well! We have a HUGE week next week, so be sure to come into it refreshed and ready.
