# Assignment Overview: Lab 9

Continue working on the functionality of your **sales.html** page if you do not have it working 100% yet, including the row of totals across the bottom.

Here's your other tasks for today:

- Style up the public facing page (**index.html**) to make it appealing to customers. NOTE: You **must** use all of the images in the adjacent asset directory. Your client insists that you use Every. Single. One.
- Your public-facing **index.html** page should have all of the things you'd expect such a page to have for such a business: locations with addresses, hours open, contact information, and so us. Just do mockups of these things since this is not a real business, of course.
- You can also mock up references (either links or little sections on the **index.html** page) for things like About Us (company history and mission), Merchandise (sales of t-shirts, mugs, stickers, etc.), links to salmon events like the Salmon Days in Issaquah, etc.

- Apply a similar style to the **sales.html** page.

	### Stretch Goals (Not required! Do either one, both, or neither)

- Any stretch goals from prior days that you have not completed.
- Make a style guide, using [this one that a team Brian was on made for Everlast](http://everlast.com/style-guide) as a model.
